# Blackjack

Final project for the class Intro to Programming.
The game is terminal-based and written in Python. I've made several changes over the years.
To run the code make sure that you have Python 3 installed on your computer, open a terminal in the directory where you have downloaded the script and type 'python blackjack.py'.

Note: ASCII art due to patorjk.com.
